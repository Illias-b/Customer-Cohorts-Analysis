## GOAL
The primary objective of this dashboard is to track customer movements across different cohorts, which are categorized based on where a customer sits within their contract cycle. This approach aims to provide a detailed and accessible view of the performance of various customer cohorts in the B2B sector. It enables data-driven decision-making by offering insights into customer behavior, sales trends, and marketing effectiveness.

## RESULT
The insights uncovered in this project were novel to the B2B team, marking a significant leap in understanding customer dynamics. The dashboard facilitated targeted marketing efforts by enabling the team to approach customers with tailored material based on their contract lifecycle status. This strategic capability enhanced the effectiveness of marketing initiatives and customer engagement.

## PROJECT DURATION
The entire project was completed within a single agile sprint, lasting no more than 3 weeks. Key activities in this sprint included:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducting a thorough examination of the data to understand underlying patterns and relationships.
- **Cohort Logic Development**: Building the logic to categorize customers into different cohorts based on their contract lifecycle.
- **Visualization Construction**: Designing and creating an intuitive and informative Tableau dashboard to display the insights.
- **Presentation of Initial Insights**: Presenting the initial findings and visualizations to stakeholders, providing them with a new perspective on customer segmentation and behavior.

This focused and efficient approach ensured that critical insights were delivered promptly, aligning perfectly with the agile methodology of rapid development and continuous improvement.
