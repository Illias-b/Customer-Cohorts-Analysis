## GOAL
The primary objective of this dashboard is to track customer movements across different cohorts, which are categorized based on where a customer sits within their contract cycle. This approach aims to provide a detailed and accessible view of the performance of various customer cohorts in the B2B sector. It enables data-driven decision-making by offering insights into customer behavior, sales trends, and marketing effectiveness.

## RESULT
The implementation of this dashboard leads to several key benefits, including:
- **Enhanced Customer Understanding**: Gaining deeper insights into different customer segments.
- **Strategic Decision Making**: Facilitating informed business decisions based on real-time data analysis.
- **Operational Efficiency**: Streamlining the process of data analysis and reporting.

## PROJECT DURATION
The development of the "CVM Base Cohorts" dashboard is typically completed within one agile sprint, amounting to no more than 3 weeks. This efficient timeframe encompasses:
- **Data Preparation and Query Development**: Crafting sophisticated SQL queries for data extraction and processing.
- **Dashboard Design and Implementation**: Constructing an interactive and informative Tableau dashboard that effectively communicates the derived data insights.
